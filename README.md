This is the core suite of plugins for the PHP-FluxAPI.

The plugins are totally optional but provide a good starting point and already solve some basic requirements of a web application.

The plugins contain:

## Storage Adapters

- MySQL
- MongoDB (planned)

## Models

- Node (simple content type with title and body)
- User (a simple user with username, email, password, ...)
- UserGroup (collects users in groups, has permissions)
- File (holds information about uploaded files)
- Permissions (planned)

## Formats

- xml
- json
- yaml
- bson (planned)
